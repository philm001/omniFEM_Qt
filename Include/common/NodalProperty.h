//! Class that is created in order to handle the nodal properties of the simulations
/*!
    This class handles the nodal properties for both the electrostatic and mangeticostatic simulations
  
    For the magnetic simulation, the user can define the vector potential, A, at a given point
    or can define a point current, J, at a given point. These two values are mutullay exlsive and
    the meaning of the value variable within the class is governed by a boolean.
  
    The vector potential A can be defined as a complex value. The units are Wbber/meter. Typically, A us
    defined as some particular value at some point in the solution domain for 
    problems with derivative boundary conditions on all sides. For the point current J, this can
    also be defined as a complex number.
  
    For electrostatic simulations, the value can be defined as either a specific voltage
    at a particular point or a pont charge density at a given point. The voltage is in units of V 
    and the point charge in units of C/m
