//! Base class for boundary conditions
/*!
    This class is the base class for the boundary conditions.
    This contains any properties that are similiar to the different
    bonudary conditions. Since we are dealing with electrostatic and magnetostatic
    simulations, the properties for boundary conditions
    that are similiar between the two are the name of the boundary condition
    and the mixed parameter boundary conditions.
  
    The mixed boundary condition has different meanings depending on the physics simulation.
    For electrostatics, the mixed boundary condition is of the form:
    \f[\varepsilon _{r}\varepsilon _{o}\frac{\partial V}{\partial n}+c_{o}V+c_{1}=0 \f]
    Depending on the vvalues of c1 and c0, the boundary can either be a Robin or Neumann
    boundary condition. If c1 = 0, then careful selection of the c0 coefficient
    will allow the boundary condition to be applied to the outer boundary
    which would approximate an unbounded solution region.
  
    For magnetiostatics, the mixed boundary condition is in the form of:
    \f[ (\frac{1}{\mu_{r}*\mu_{0}})*\frac{\delta A}{\delta n}+c_{o}*A+c_{1}=0 \f].
    Depending on the values of c1 and c0, the boundary condition can be either 
    a Neumann boundary condition or a Robin bonudary condition. For this, there are 
    2 cases for a mixed boundary condition:
    
    1) Much like the electrostatic, the mixed boundary can be used to approximate
    an unboundaed solution region.
  
    2) The mixed boundary conditoin can be used to set the field intensity H that flows
    parallel to a boundary. c0 would need to be set to 0 and c1 set to the desired
    H value in A/M. This boundary condition can also be used to prescribe 
    dA/dn=0 at the boundary.
