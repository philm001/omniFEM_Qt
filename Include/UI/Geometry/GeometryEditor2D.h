     *  So you might be thinking, why use a colony instead of a vector or a list or a deque?
     *  It is simple, for a vector, when something is added or removed, the vector
     *  copies all of of the contents from one memory location to another. This can cause significant speed issues
     *  with a large amount of data. Also, in some datatypes, we are storing the address of the node.
     *  If the address changes everytime we add or remove soemthing from
     *  the vector, this can create a number of issues.
     *  For a list, everything was already coded using vectors when the vector issue was discover which results
     *  in a preference for using a deque since it contains many functions similiar to that of the vector and so the deque datatype was
     *  the prefered choice. The list is also much slower then a deque. However, it was discovered that when an element 
     *  was added or removed for the deque, the addresses became invalidated.A hybrid was needed between the 
     *  list's ability to keep all of the addresses validated when changing the list but have the speed of a deque.
     *  Further research found the plf::colony class. It functions similiar to a list
     *  and you have many of the benefits of using a list but with the added speed bonus of a deque

        For arcs, an arc shape containing the selected nodes, boundary conditions, and nuumber of segments
        should be passed into here first. Mainly becuase the arc needs to be setup before any calculation can 
        be done on the arc and it simplifies the number of arguments needed for the function to work.
        One thing to note about arcs is that the order of selection matters. All arcs are drawn as 
        counterclockwise being positive. Therefor, an arc is drawn concave if the endpoint to the right
        is selected first and convex if the node to the left is selected first.
        This function also checks and handles the following cases: if the arc crosses a node,
        if the arc intersects another arc or if the arc intersects a line, and if the arc already exists 
        in the list.
        The function can handle first the selection of the endpoints but it is highly recommmanded
        that the arSeg argument contains the selection of the nodes, any BC, and number of segments before 
        calling this function.

        \return Returns True if the function successfully added the arc to the list. Otherwise returns False. A false condition occurs if the arc is already in the list, if the two selected nodes are the same, or if one of the two selected nodes does not exist
